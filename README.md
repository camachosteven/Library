# Library.rb
Collection of Books where you can check-in and checkout as a guest, plus other options as an administrator

If you want to access the library as an administrator, the program will ask for your password. Afterwards, you have four actions 
available. You can add books into the library's inventory, remove book(s) from the library's inventory, or display the checkin/checkout 
books for each book. 

If you want to access the library as a guest, you have two actions available. You can either checkin or checkout a book for 20 days max. 
The library will charge 25 cents per every day that the book's late.
